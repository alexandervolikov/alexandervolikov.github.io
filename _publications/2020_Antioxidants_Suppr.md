The introduction of various concentrations of chemically modiﬁed humic compounds (HC) with diﬀerent redox characteristics into the media with free and immobilized anaerobic consortia accumulating landﬁll gases was studied as approach to their functioning management. For this purpose, quinone (hydroquinone, naphthoquinone or methylhydroquinone) derivatives of HC were synthesized, which made it possible to vary the redox and antioxidant properties of HC as terminal electron acceptors in methanogenic systems. The highest acceptor properties were obtained with potassium humate modiﬁed by naphthoquinone. To control possible negative eﬀect of HC on the cells of natural methanogenic consortia, diﬀerent bioluminescent analytical methods were used. The addition of HC derivatives, enriched with quinonones, to nutrient media at concentrations above 1 g/L decreased the energetic status of cells and the eﬃciency of the methanogenesis. For the ﬁrst time, the signiﬁcant decrease in accumulation of biogas was reached as eﬀect of synthetic HC derivatives, whereas both notable change of biogas composition towards increase in the CO2 content and decrease in CH4 were revealed. Thus, modiﬁcation with quinones makes it possible to obtain low-potential HC derivatives with strongly pronounced acceptor properties, promising for inhibition of biogas synthesis by methanogenic communities.
