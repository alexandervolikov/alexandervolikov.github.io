Comparative analysis of the extracted samples by ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry demonstrated selectivity of the selected adsorbents to the components of the molecular assembly of HS: the XAD-8 resin has affinity to the higher oxidized aromatic compounds and PPL has affinity to substances of stronger aliphatic character and nitrogen-containing compounds. Because of this fact, a comparison of the molecular composition of HS isolated from various sources must be performed taking into account selective adsorption; therefore, it is necessary to compare the products extracted by the same adsorbent for correct interpretation.},

The major advantage of the proposed adsorbents is that of an ecologically sound procedure of immobilizing silanized humic derivatives onto silica gel in aquatic solutions. The silanized humic derivatives, in turn, are obtained without a use of organic solvent by reacting natural humic materials from peat and coal with 3-aminopropyltriethoxyorganosilane in water. These silanized derivatives are surface active and are capable of self assembling into humic adlayers at the water solid interface. A use of this approach allows for immobilization of up to 220 mg of humic materials per 1 g of SiO2. The adsorption capacity of humics-modiﬁed silica gels with respect to the Direct Brown 1 trisazo dye varied from 3.5 up to 8.8 mg per 1 g of SiO2. The maximum sorption obtained for the silanized derivative with 50\% modiﬁcation degree was comparable to adsorption capacity of activated coal to this dye (7.5 mg gÀ1).

              Water-based humic substances-silsesquioxane (HS-SQ) soft materials are synthesized by hydrolysis of (3-aminopropyl-triethoxy)-silane in the HS solution. The aggregation dynamics of this system was studied using
              in situ
              small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) technique, which revealed three consecutive stages in the evolution of the HS-SQ system based on its fractal dimension (
              D
              ): HS-SQ oligomeric polyelectrolyte complexes with
              D
              {\textless} 2.5; loosely bound HS-SQ networks with 2.5 {\textless}

              D
              {\textgreater} 3 (surface fractals). It was suggested that the reaction time needed for the HS-SQ system to transit from mass to surface fractal stage can be used to control its self-assembly onto a solid support. The corresponding studies have confirmed that the HS-SQ networks could be successfully immobilized onto sand columns only at the aggregation stage with fractal dimensions of 2.5 {\textless}

The corresponding lab column studies have demonstrated successful passive installation of a humic permeable reactive barrier on sand which was capable of intercepting azo dyes from contaminated water. The prospects of using HS-SQ soft materials in nature-inspired remedial technologies and soil restoration are discussed.},

For this purpose, quinone (hydroquinone, naphthoquinone or methylhydroquinone) derivatives of HC were synthesized, which made it possible to vary the redox and antioxidant properties of HC as terminal electron acceptors in methanogenic systems. The highest acceptor properties were obtained with potassium humate modiﬁed by naphthoquinone. To control possible negative eﬀect of HC on the cells of natural methanogenic consortia, diﬀerent bioluminescent analytical methods were used. The addition of HC derivatives, enriched with quinonones, to nutrient media at concentrations above 1 g/L decreased the energetic status of cells and the eﬃciency of the methanogenesis. For the ﬁrst time, the signiﬁcant decrease in accumulation of biogas was reached as eﬀect of synthetic HC derivatives, whereas both notable change of biogas composition towards increase in the CO2 content and decrease in CH4 were revealed. Thus, modiﬁcation with quinones makes it possible to obtain low-potential HC derivatives with strongly pronounced acceptor properties, promising for inhibition of biogas synthesis by methanogenic communities.},

The first two fractions characterize the active OM pool, and the latter fraction characterizes the slow OM pool. Overall, the extractable OM fractions make it possible to assess the content and qualitative composition of the active and slow OM pools and, in an indirect manner, of the passive OM pool. The content of dissolved organic carbon in the extracts is used to quantify the yield of fractions, and the spectral characteristics of light absorption in the ultraviolet and visible ranges attest to their qualitative composition. The main attention is focused on the OM recovery in the chernozems after an extreme regime (permanent tilled fallow) and on the differences in the OM of soil aggregates in dependence on their size. A large part of plant residues entering the soil during the recovery of the chernozem after the extreme conditions of tilled fallow is fixed in the passive OM pool. The qualitative composition of active pools is restored much faster than their quantity typical of the undisturbed cenoses.

	abstract = {Humic substances (HSs) are important for the functioning and stability of soil ecosystems; their physical and chemical properties, as well as their influence on plants and animals are well studied. However, the role of HSs in the physiology of microorganisms, in particular, in their survival under unfavorable conditions, is understood insufficiently. To evaluate the role of various chemical groups and physicochemical properties of HSs in the survival of soil bacteria, experiments were performed using eight HS preparations with different structure and properties. Addition of HSs to cultures of hydrocarbonoxidizing soil bacteria Rhodococcus erythropolis and Pseudomonas extremaustralis increased the titers of viable cells after 30 days of storage up to 10 times. This biological effect of HSs is due to their ability to stimulate the formation of stress-resistant persister cells. Correlation analysis established a relationship between the biological activity of HS and the atomic content of hydrogen and carbon, hydrophobicity, and the average molecular weight of HS. The atomic content of oxygen, as well as the content of CHn groups and various oxygen-containing groups (CH3O, CH2O, CHO, C=O, Alk-O) correlated with a negative effect of HS on bacterial viability. The content of aromatic groups and antioxidant capacity correlated with both activating and inhibiting biological activity of HSs. The stabilizing effect of HSs on bacterial cells is explained by their antioxidant activity, as well as by their ability to serve as a carbon source and to act as a terminal electron acceptor in the absence of oxygen. The obtained results elucidate an important function of HSs: to ensure long-term survival of bacteria in soil ecosystems in the periods between their active development.},

The Urbic Technosol was used as a model soil. The size and amount of water-stable soil aggregates were estimated using wet sieving and laser diffraction, respectively. Toxicity was evaluated by monitoring microbial substrate-induced respiration (SIR) and seedling bioassay. Laboratory column experiments demonstrated an increase in water-stability of the 3–5 mm soil aggregates after LHSAPTES application. Field tests showed an increase in the average weighted diameter of micro aggregates (from 59 to 73 µm) and water-stable macroaggregates (from 1.6 to 2.9 mm) due to the LHS-APTES amendment. A substantial increase in SIR from 5 to 9 mg CO2 (kg h)−1 was detected. Better survival of seedlings was observed.

We hypothesized that a directed modiﬁcation of the humic backbone via incorporation of redox moieties with known redox properties might provide an efﬁcient tool for tuning up antioxidant properties of HS. In this work, hydroquinonoid and hydronaphthoquinonoid centres were used, which possess very different redox characteristics. They were incorporated into the structure of coal (leonardite) humic acids CHA) and peat fulvic acids (PFA). For this goal, an oxidative copolymerization of phenols was used. The latter was induced via oxidation of hydroquinones and hydroxynapjtaquinones with a use of Fenton’s reagent. The structure of the obtained products was characterized using NMR and FTIR spectroscopy. H/D labelling coupled to FT ICR mass spectrometry analysis was applied for identiﬁcation of the reaction products as a tool for surmising on reaction mechanism. It was shown that covalent -C-C- bond were formed between the incorporated redox centers and aromatic core of HS. The parent humic acids and their naphthoquinonoid derivatives have demonstrated high accepting capacity. At the same time, fulvic acids and their hydroquinonoid derivatives have possessed both high donor and high antioxidant capacities. The kinetic studies have demonstrated that both humic acids and their derivatives showed much slower kinetics of antioxidant reactions as compared to fulvic acids. The obtained results show, ﬁrstly, substantial difference in redox and antioxidant properties of the humic and fulvic acids, and, secondly, they can serve as an experimental evidence that directed chemical modiﬁcation of humic substances can be used to tune and control antioxidant properties of natural HS.},

              As the production of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) expands, so might the potential for their release into the environment. Accurate risk assessment of ENMs in the environment is important for sustainable development and application of nanotechnologies. Nanodiamonds (NDs) occupy a special niche among ENMs and are ENMs at high risk of entering the environment. We evaluated interactions between NDs and a broad range of soils (retisols, phaeozems, chernozems, kastanozems, and solonetz) using tritium-labeled nanoparticles. The retention of NDs by the soils due to both binding to the solid phase of the soil and aggregation in the presence of soil solutes varied from 9.6 to 87.1 mg kg
              −1
              . Additionally, the effect of soil water-extractable components on NDs was studied in terms of alleviation of their size and

	abstract = {Large scale isolation—in gram quantities—of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from natural waters is necessary for detailed investigation of its role in chemical and microbial processes driving carbon cycling under conditions of global climate change. The best candidate for a use in these large-scale experiments is a bulk sorbent Bondesil PPL, which has the same modiﬁcation as the widely used Bond Elut PPL sorbent. There have been no studies so far reported on interchangeability of these sorbents with regard to DOM isolation. This work was devoted to comparative studies on sorption efﬁciency and molecular selectivity of these two sorbents—Bond Elut PPL and Bondesil PPL with regard to DOM components. Fulvic acids (FA) from peat water leachate were used as a model DOM. Laboratory solid phase extraction (SPE) setup was used for monitoring sorption recovery and extraction yield. It included three parallel experiments on pre-packed Bond Elut PPL cartridges (500 mg/3 mL) and three self-packed Bondesil PPL cartridges (500 mg/3 mL). Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT ICR MS) and 13C/1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy were used for determination of molecular and structural group compositions of the FA isolates obtained with a use of two different sorbents. The results of this study allowed a conclusion on interchangeability of the two sorbents used in this study for the purposes of DOM isolation from natural waters. This conclusion was backed up by similarity of sorption behavior of the peat FA components on both sorbents and by high similarity of molecular compositions and carbon distribution among the main structural groups.},

Introduction of methanogenesis suppressors such as redox derivatives of humic acids, potassium persulfate (­ K2S2O8), possessing oxidizing and electron acceptor properties, enzyme hexahistidine-containing organophosphorus hydrolase with high lactonase activity and polypeptide antimicrobial agent bacitracin into the media with anaerobic consortia were studied. The effect of these substances was directed at various participants of the natural methanogenic consortium, as well as on the biochemical processes carried out by them. The use of ­K2S2O8 together with bacitracin provided maximum and almost complete suppression of ­CH4 production. The measured concentration of intracellular adenosine triphosphate has shown that viability of cells in the consortium remained almost the same, whereas their metabolic activity decreased. Various combinations of the above-mentioned suppressors provided different degrees of methanogenesis suppression, but redox agents played a key role in all the cases studied. Based on the accumulated data, combining suppressors in different concentrations can be used to manage the methanogenesis (efficiency and velocity of its decrease) in media with anaerobic consortia.},

It was shown that the batch sorption isotherms were best fitted with the Langmuir model, the sorption constants were 8.6·103 L·kgOC−1 and 10.7·103 L·kgOC−1 for Bond Elut PPL and Bondesil PPL, respec­ tively. Breakthrough curves were satisfactorily fitted by a logistic equation; the maximum sorbent loading was 13\% (wt. dissolved organic carbon) for both sorbents. The relationship between loading values and optical descriptors of the DOM at the column exit showed preferential sorption of low molecular weight aromatic DOM components in the range of low loading values (up to 4\%), the similar trends were observed for size exclusion chromatography (SEC) measurements. Much lesser impact of loading onto molecular composition was observed within the range from 4 to 8\% dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Given high recovery values (70–85\%) in this loading range, it can be recommended as preferential for conducting DOM isolation from natural waters using SPE PPLmodified sorbents.},

TEM images revealed that the star-shaped aggregates of 200–500 nm ZnO particles were formed in the absence of HS, whereas the presence of humic ligands led to shapeless smaller particles ranging from 20 to 200 nm. UV-Vis spectra showed increasing of zinc oxide band gap caused with an rise of HS concentration. The band gap of ZnO nanoparticles increased from 3.19 eV to 3.40 eV as the concentration of HS increased up to 15 g/L. The synthesized ZnO-HS nanocomposites were used for ﬁlling in the hydrogels of carboxymethylcellulose (CMC). The release studies of zinc ions from the gel into different buffers were conducted to imitate wound conditions.

The HS–ASQ compositions were found to have a high sorption capacity for dust particles and could form coatings on their surface without cementing the dust, making them potentially useful for environmental applications. The viscosity of the HS–ASQ compositions can be controlled by adding carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), which also enhances their dust suppression abilities. Different compositions of HS–ASQ were synthesized by varying the proportions of APTES and CMC, and dust treated with these samples was assessed for its resistance to wind erosion using a laboratory-scale setup. Treatment with the HS–ASQ composition resulted in substantial reductions in PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters of 10 µm and 2.5 µm, respectively) of up to 77\% and 85\%, respectively, compared to the control.},

The aim is to investigate the antioxidant activity (AOA) of HS matrices (macroligands) and AgNPs stabilized with humic macroligands (HS-AgNPs). The unique chemical feature of HSs makes them very promising ligands (matrices) for AgNP stabilization. HSs have previously been shown to exert many pharmacological eﬀects mediated by their AOA. AgNPs stabilized with HS showed a pronounced ability to bind to reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the test with ABTS. Also, higher AOA was observed for HS-AgNPs as compared to the HS matrices. In vitro cytotoxicity studies have shown that the stabilization of AgNPs with the HS matrices reduces the cytotoxicity of AgNPs. As a result of in vitro experiments with the use of 2,7-dichlorodihydroßuorescein diacetate (DCFDA), it was found that all HS materials tested and the HS-AgNPs did not exhibit prooxidant eﬀects. Moreover, more pronounced AOA was shown for HS-AgNP samples as compared to the original HS matrices. Two putative mechanisms of the pronounced AOA of the tested compositions are proposed: Þrstly, the pronounced ability of HSs to inactivate ROS and, secondly, the large surface area and surface-to-volume ratio of HS-AgNPs, which facilitate electron transfer and mitigate kinetic barriers to the reduction reaction. As a result, the antioxidant properties of the tested HS-AgNPs might be of particular interest for biomedical applications aimed at inhibiting the growth of bacteria and viruses and the healing of purulent wounds.},

Humic acids (HAs) play an important role in the regulation of PTE mobility in soil and water. The permafrost thaw releases ancient organic matter (OM) with a speciﬁc molecular composition into the Arctic watersheds. This could affect the mobility of PTEs in the region. In our study, we isolated HAs from two types of permafrost deposits: the Yedoma ice complex, which contains pristine buried OM, and the alas formed in the course of multiple thaw–refreezing cycles with the most altered OM. We also used peat from the non-permafrost region as the recent environmental endmember for the evolution of Arctic OM. The HAs were characterized using 13C NMR and elemental analysis. Adsorption experiments were conducted to assess the afﬁnity of HAs for binding Cu2+ and Ni2+. It was found that Yedoma HAs were enriched with aliphatic and N-containing structures as compared to the much more aromatic and oxidized alas and peat HAs. The adsorption experiments have revealed that the peat and alas HAs have a higher afﬁnity for binding both ions as compared to the Yedoma HAs. The obtained data suggest that a substantial release of the OM from the Yedoma deposits due to a rapid thaw of the permafrost might increase the mobility of PTEs and their toxicity in the Arctic Ocean because of much lesser “neutralization potential”.},

              This article reviews a variety of literature-reported lignin isolation procedures that bring partly minor but important changes in the produced extracts. Five lignins were produced or acquired from various sources and characterized based on their thermal properties, molecular weights, chemical structures, as well as elemental compositions, which were all found to depend on their extraction methods. These extracts were then used to produce 5 different nanolignins using 2 similar facile solvent shifting methods with the difference being an alteration in pH. The nanolignins were characterized after the solvent shifting accounting for differences in pH. Nanolignins generated
              via
              only solvent exchange exhibited diameters ranging from 58 nm to 95 nm, while nanolignins precipitated using a solvent shifting method along with a shift in pH exhibited diameters ranging from 10 nm to 34 nm and dissimilar morphology, size, and surface charge. Those differences highlight the control options for nanolignin preparetion on the colloidal length scale. Understanding how different lignins can be used to generate nanolignins is mandatory for unlocking the possibilities of nanolignin for functional material applications. These nanolignins can be applied in construction, medical, and/or agricultural industries as renewable, biodegradable alternatives to existing polymer dispersions.},

Microbial immobilization is a common and efficient method to preserve high viable cell titers. We tested the effect of three new materials on the survival of various hydrocarbon oxidizers during long-term storage. The suspended (planktonic) cultures stored under the same conditions served as a control when assessing the viability of immobilized cultures after long-term storage. The cells of Acinetobacter seifertii, Pseudomonas extremaustralis, P. aeruginosa, Rhodococcus erythropolis, and Dietzia maris grown with microcapsules (MCs) of chitosan-modified polyurea (represented by crumpled spheres, 40–200 µm in diameter) attached abundantly to the MC surface. After several months of storage with MCs, CFU titers were two to five times higher than in the control. Cultivation of P. aeruginosa and R. erythropolis with polylactide (PLA) MCs (represented by slightly crumpled thin-walled spheres 25–100 µm in size) resulted in the formation of thick biofilms on MC surface. After 30-day storage with these MCs, CFU titers of R. erytropolis were up to one thousand times higher than in the control. In the presence of PLA MCs, the respiration rates of both cultures were five to eight times higher than in the control without MCs. The reasons of the better survival of immobilized cells are being discussed. After storage for up to 12 months, CFU titers of bacteria (R. erythropolis, A. seifertii, P. aeruginosa, P. extremaustralis) and yeasts (Yarrovia lipolytica) immobilized in the gel based on silanol derivatives of humic substances were ten to one hundred times higher than in the control. After 4-month storage, hydrocarbon degradation by the stabilized cultures began earlier and was faster and more complete than in the control. The tested materials may be used to extend the storage time for the preparations of biotechnologically important bacteria and for application for petroleum bioremediation.},

	abstract = {This study presents a new strategy for the production of sustainable manganese fertilizer based on artificial humic substances (AHS). AHS with different manganese concentrations (0‒20\%) were synthesized from poplar bark under alkaline conditions via hydrothermal treatment. For the 20\% manganese formulation, the interaction of manganese with AHS resulted in reduced solubility (from 25.2\% to 12.3\% organic carbon) and average molecular weight of humic acids (from 11.6 to 3.9 KDa), indicating preferential binding of the high-molecular-weight fraction. The formulation with 5\% of manganese achieved optimal manganese loading without compromising the AHS solubility (19.4\%). Structural analyses showed only minor changes in AHS in the presence of manganese, indicating that the main structural fragments of the AHS were preserved. Structural, morphological, and spectroscopic characterizations confirmed the formation of amorphous manganese complexes within the AHS matrix, primarily in the plant-available Mn(II) oxidation state. Plant bioassays showed increased manganese uptake with the application of AHS containing 5\% Mn compared to MnCl2 alone (64 mg/kg vs. 40 mg/kg in dry cucumber biomass). Interestingly, unmodified AHS at higher concentrations (50 mg/L) further enhanced manganese (67 mg/kg) and iron (up to 209 mg/kg) uptake, highlighting the potential role of AHS in facilitating metal transport.},
