The objective was to estimate suitability of humics-modiﬁed silica gels for adsorptive removal of the Direct Brown 1 trisazo dye from aqueous phase. The major advantage of the proposed adsorbents is that of an ecologically sound procedure of immobilizing silanized humic derivatives onto silica gel in aquatic solutions. The silanized humic derivatives, in turn, are obtained without a use of organic solvent by reacting natural humic materials from peat and coal with 3-aminopropyltriethoxyorganosilane in water. These silanized derivatives are surface active and are capable of self assembling into humic adlayers at the water solid interface. A use of this approach allows for immobilization of up to 220 mg of humic materials per 1 g of SiO2. The adsorption capacity of humics-modiﬁed silica gels with respect to the Direct Brown 1 trisazo dye varied from 3.5 up to 8.8 mg per 1 g of SiO2. The maximum sorption obtained for the silanized derivative with 50\% modiﬁcation degree was comparable to adsorption capacity of activated coal to this dye (7.5 mg gÀ1). The results of this adsorption study, warrant further studies of azo dye removal from aqueous environments.
