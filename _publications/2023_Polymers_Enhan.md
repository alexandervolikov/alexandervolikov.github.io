The current article describes the biological activity of new biomaterials combining the “green” properties of humic substances (HSs) and silver nanoparticles. The aim is to investigate the antioxidant activity (AOA) of HS matrices (macroligands) and AgNPs stabilized with humic macroligands (HS-AgNPs). The unique chemical feature of HSs makes them very promising ligands (matrices) for AgNP stabilization. HSs have previously been shown to exert many pharmacological eﬀects mediated by their AOA. AgNPs stabilized with HS showed a pronounced ability to bind to reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the test with ABTS. Also, higher AOA was observed for HS-AgNPs as compared to the HS matrices. In vitro cytotoxicity studies have shown that the stabilization of AgNPs with the HS matrices reduces the cytotoxicity of AgNPs. As a result of in vitro experiments with the use of 2,7-dichlorodihydroßuorescein diacetate (DCFDA), it was found that all HS materials tested and the HS-AgNPs did not exhibit prooxidant eﬀects. Moreover, more pronounced AOA was shown for HS-AgNP samples as compared to the original HS matrices. Two putative mechanisms of the pronounced AOA of the tested compositions are proposed- Þrstly, the pronounced ability of HSs to inactivate ROS and, secondly, the large surface area and surface-to-volume ratio of HS-AgNPs, which facilitate electron transfer and mitigate kinetic barriers to the reduction reaction. As a result, the antioxidant properties of the tested HS-AgNPs might be of particular interest for biomedical applications aimed at inhibiting the growth of bacteria and viruses and the healing of purulent wounds.
