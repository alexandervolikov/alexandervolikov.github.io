I'd like to share my recent article in Polymers. In this research, we explore a novel environmentally friendly approach to controlling dust from unpaved roads using polyelectrolyte complexes of humic substances and aminorganosilanol. Given the potential health risks associated with particulate matter (PM), this is a vital research area. We hope that our findings will have practical applications in reducing PM concentrations.
